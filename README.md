# Open Source @ SendGrid

# Purpose

Originally, this repository existed for Hacktoberfest 2018.  Yet, we thought that it would be great to have a general repository to aggregate our open source efforts in one place.  We can also use this for capturing new ideas that don't fit into one of our existing repositories.
